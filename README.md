## 🎯 Project Vet – *Work in Progress*

**Project Vet** is a complete overhaul of an outdated veterinary clinic website based in Australia. As part of my development learning journey, I'm applying modern **UI/UX best practices** and **frontend development** techniques to rebuild the site from scratch.

Since I’m currently balancing university classes and bootcamps, I’m gradually developing and committing updates to this project.

[Their current website can be found here](https://wyndhamvet.com.au/)
